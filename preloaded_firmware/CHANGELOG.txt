I-NUCLEO-LRWAN Preloaded AT command Software - CHANGELOG
=====================================================================

Changes for version 4.0.2

* bug - fix
  * fixed that module can not report message "AT_ERROR_WAN_SEND" if moudle is unvailable to send packets in fw 4.0.1.


* New features:

  * Add command event for: AT+JOIN

    Syntax:

    AT+JOIN=<join_protocol>[,<event_enabled>]

	     <join_protocol> => 0:ABP, 1:OTAA
	     <event_enabled> => 0:event_disabled, 1:event_enabled

    Responses:

      OK                       command recieved without error.

    Events:

    	 +JoinAccepted            notice LoRaWAN networking now is joned
    	 +JoinRetry: <Count>      notice a join request will be resent, if event_enabled is set. 

    
  * Add command event for: AT+SEND

    Syntax:

    AT+SEND=<port>,<payload in hex string format>,<confirm_needed>[,<event_enabled>]

	      <port>           => a port number 0 ~ 255 for the payload
	      <payload>        => the payload in hex string format.
       <confirm_needed> => 0: no ask needed, 1: ask needed.
	      <event_enabled>  => 0:event_disabled, 1:event_enabled

    Response:

    	 OK                       command recieved without error.

    Events:

    	 +TX: Retry, <Count>      if event_enabled is set then module will notice host the packet will be resent, if ACK not received.
    	 +TX: Error, -110         if event_enabled is set then module will notice host module is stopped to send the packet if TX errors, -110 is ack timeout.
    	+TX: Done                if event_enabled is set then module will notice host packet was sent successfully.
